# sofi

sofi is a remote docker based sandbox code execution engine written in Go.

Currently it supports the following languages:

- Go (golang:1.18-alpine)
- Java (openjdk:8u232-jdk)
- C (gcc:latest)
- C++ (gcc:latest)
- Python (python:3.9.1-alpine)
- JavaScript (node:lts-alpine)

## Installation

For the installation of sofi, you need to have Docker and Go installed.

It is required for the sandbox environment to have a all-in-one image that includes all the functionality for executing the code in a docker container. For that, you need to create and build the image in `build/all-in-one-ubuntu`. You can do that by executing the `create-image` command in the `Makefile` or by executing:

```sh
docker build build/all-in-one-ubuntu -t all-in-one-ubuntu
```
## Usage

You can feel free to run the CLI by executing the `main.go` file in the root directory with the following command:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

This will prompt you with some flags and commands you can use.

In addition, you can start the REST API running the `main.go` file in the `rest` directory. This will start the REST API on port `9090`.

### Commands and Flags for the CLI

The following section contains all the commands and flags that can be used while running the CLI.
